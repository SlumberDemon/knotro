## Knotro

### why

In this branch of the fork, you will find a modified version of the original app but with the deta python library replaced by a local solution.

### how

To use this navigate into the `app` directory and create a new folder called `data`. In there put the `knotro_notes.json` file and the `notes` folder from your deta space export. Then after installing the requirements, you can run the app with `uvicorn main:app` from the `app` directory.
