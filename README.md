## Knotro

## why

This fork exists because the platform where I initially used knotro has been shut down. With this fork, I aim to revive one of my favourite note-taking apps. Thank you to xeust for creating [knotro](https://github.com/xeust/knotro)!
The master branch includes the original source code. Checkout the different branches for new versions.

### General Info

*Knotro* gives you a "box" of notes. It is a minimal micro-homage to the bi-directional linking in tools like Roam Research, Obsidian, etc.


### Deployment / Usage

Knotro is running on [Deta Space](https://deta.space/discovery/@max/knospace).

It could, with little modification, be configured to run elsewhere (it's a FastAPI app), but a database is needed.

### Other Info

The `app` directory contains the app
